HTML forms are the backbone of interactive websites. 
They allow users to submit data, which can be processed on the server.
 While we have covered basic input types in previous tutorials, this tutorial aims to delve deeper into form attributes, both common and new HTML5 additions. We'll also look at HTML5 validation attributes to ensure data integrity.

Common Attributes
action
The action attribute specifies the URL where the form data should be sent after submission.

<form action="/submit.php" method="POST">
</form>
method
The method attribute defines how data is sent. The two most common methods are GET and POST.

<form action="/submit.php" method="POST">

name
The name attribute specifies the name for the form element, making it easier to reference in scripts or the server-side code.

<input type="text" name="username">
